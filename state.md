## Importance of State diagrams in our Elm UI
Model Driven Development (MDD) is about speeding the development process. In our case the state diagrams were a way to speed up this process, otherwise we would have taken so much time to modify the cases, update function, etc. if we created everything from scratch

## How is model development engineering (EE) different from (MDD)
Model driven engineering is about simulating the device, not just generating the code i.e. being able to identify properties of the software

So basically using states is a way of overviewing what functionality our app has. Otherwise, we would have to manually test every feature that we have and then implement changes which wastes a lot of time.
